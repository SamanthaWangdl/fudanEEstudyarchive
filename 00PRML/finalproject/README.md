# MIT AICURE OPEN TASK
COVID-19 presents many health challenges beyond the virus itself. One of them is finding effective antibiotics for secondary infections.  Help us improve machine learning models for predicting antibacterial properties. We have released a new screening dataset, and are reporting our current results on this benchmark here.

The task is to predict a target compoundâ€™s property from its molecular structure.

This repo includes my code and report for this open task and this task was the final project for Fudan PRML course.
